Installation
============

*NOTE*: Currently, Chomper is only tested for Debian-based distributions, i.e. Linux Mint, Ubuntu, and Debian. You should be able to install Chomper manually on other distributions, but I don't have explicit instructions. If you're trying to install Chomper on a non Debian-based distribution, look at the ~init~ rule of the Makefile for guidance.
